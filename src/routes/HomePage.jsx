            <p>This is a showcase of React functionality and code.</p>
            <p>Some parts use <b>context</b> and others use <b>Redux (toolkit)</b>. While not necesary, or even correct, this is done on purpose just for the sake of it.</p>
            <p>There is no UI design, but I was considering using <b>Tailwind</b> for styling.</p>
            <p>A list of "things to do" is in the README.md file.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Use the navbar to go between pages.</p>
