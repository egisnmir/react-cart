#### To run it locally simply do:
1. yarn install
2. yarn start
3. localhost:3000

#### Things to add:
* Redux (toolkit)
* TypeScript
* Add product search input
* Add a check to see if count of items changed, send appropriate notification
* Add a reviews page and a "write a review" form
* Add useReducer to contexts
* Testing. Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
* Add products comparison feature
* Products should get data from an API (using fetch or axios)
  Maybe create a very simple backend with NodeJs
* Add themes using context
* Implement Tailwind
* Add styled-components
